However, when we tried running additional queries, 
we noticed that only one output was being displayed, 
regardless of the code we executed. We attempted various troubleshooting steps,

from our professor regarding what might have gone wrong. We would also appreciate further 
guidance on how to properly execute these queries to ensure that the expected results are displayed correctly.
